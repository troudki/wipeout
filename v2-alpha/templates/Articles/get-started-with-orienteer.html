<h1>Orienteer</h1>

<p>
	Orienteer is a very simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</a> library which is included with wipeout.
</p>
<p>
If OOP isn't your thing, don't worry, it is used under the hood but is an optional method of creating wipeout viewModels.<br/>
If you like OOP, check out the docs <a href="https://github.com/ShaneGH/orienteer" target="_blank">here</a>.
