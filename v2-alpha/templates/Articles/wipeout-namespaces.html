<h1>Wipeout namespaces</h1>

<p>Wipeout has two root namespaces which you can use interchangeably. The root namespace is <code>window.wipeout</code> which contains all of the public and 
private functionality of the library.</p>
<p>There is a second namespace <code>window.wo</code> which is an amalgamation of the <code>window.wipeout.base</code> and <code>window.wipeout.utils</code> namespaces,
 and is meant as a convenient alias for its longer namespace counterparts.</p>
