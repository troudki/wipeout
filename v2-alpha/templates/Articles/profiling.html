<h1>Profiling</h1>

<p>Wipeout has a built in rough and ready profiler. To open it, just open a console window and type <code>wipeout.profile.profile()</code>. Try it on this site!<br/>
    With the profiler you can:
<ul>
    <li>Highlight viewModel html by hovering over it</li>
    <li>View the hierarchy of viewModels by honding ctrl+click (does not always work with clickable items in IE)</li>
    <li>View the rendering, initialization and template compile time of each viewModel. In order to see these stats, profiling must be turned on
    before the item is rendered, so before you call <code>ko.applyBindings(...)</code></li>
    <li>Debug the viewModel and model objects themselves, by opening a console window and clicking on a viewModel header</li>
    <li>Turn off proiling by calling <code>wipeout.profile.profile(false)</code>.</li>
</ul>
