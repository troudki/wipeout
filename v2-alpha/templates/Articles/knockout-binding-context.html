<h1>The knocout binding context</h1>

<p>The <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/binding-context.html">knockout binding ocntext</a> is the scope provided by knockout.
	The general scope will be the viewModel, however there are several other properties which may be useful within a wipeout application: </p>

<ol>
	<li><code>$parent</code>: refers to the parent viewModel. This property is very important when setting the model of viewModel, as you 
		will always want to set it to a property on <code>$parent.model</code>.</li>
	<li><code>$parents[]</code>: refers to all ancestor viewModels. So <code>$parents[0] === $parent</code>, <code>$parents[1] === $parent.getParent(true)</code>
and so on. It is best practice only to refer to parents in the current template script block in this way so keep components from depending on eachother</li>
	<li><code>$index</code>: refers to the index of an item within an <a href="/wipeout/## insert: site-directory ##/api.html?type=api&amp;className=wo.list">list</a>.</li>
</ol>
