<h1>Binding or setting properties</h1>

<p>Binding properties is the process of binding the value of a property on one model or viewModel to that of another viewModel. Changes to one property will then reflect in other properties, depending on the <wipeout-docs.rl text="'type of binding'" href="'/wipeout/## insert: site-directory ##/how-do-i.html?article=binding-types'"></wipeout-docs.rl> used.
