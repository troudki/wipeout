<h1>Binding to non observables</h1>
<p>When something is bound within a template, part of the process is to watch 
    the variable for change, so that the DOM, or other view models can be updated accordingly. Plain old 
    javascript objects cannot be watched, they must first be converted to observables with
    <a href="https://github.com/ShaneGH/busybody#attempting-to-observe-a-value" target="_blank">busybody.makeObservable</a>.
</p>
<h2>Strategies</h2>
<p>There are three binding strategies you can use</p>
<h3>1. Create Observables (default)</h3>
<p>This strategy will bind to anything. Given the path:
<code>$model.item1.item2</code>, where neither <code>$model</code> nor <code>item1</code> are observables, wipeout will convert these values to observables before binding so that any changes to <code>$model.item1</code> or <code>item1.item2</code> can be observed. Once the binding is destroyed or an item is no longer present in the path, the item will then be converted back to a non observable.
</p>
<p>There is overhead in creating observables, and if you are building a large SPA with many long binding paths, this strategy might not be optimal.</p>

<h3>2. Bind non Observables</h3>
<p>This strategy will bind to anything that it can. Given the path:
<code>$model.item1.item2</code>, where <code>item1</code> is an observable, but <code>$model</code> is not, wipeout will do it's best to bind. This means that if <code>item1.item2</code> changes, wipeout will update the DOM, however, if <code>$model.item1</code> changes, wipeout will not.
</p>

<h3>3. Only Bind Observables</h3>
<p>This strategy will only bind until it reaches a break in the observable chain. Given the path:
<code>$model.item1.item2</code>, where <code>item1</code> is an observable, but <code>$model</code> is not wipeout will not bind, as the first link in the chain (<code>$model</code>) is not observable.<br />
If <code>$model</code> were to be observable but <code>item1</code> were not, wipeout act the same as if <b>Bind non Observabls</b> were used, altering the DOM if <code>$model.item1</code> changes, but not if <code>item1.item2</code> changes.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>In practice, the best strategy will be a mix of all three, setting a default which suits the application and altering specific view models to either increase or decreases the amount of observables created. You can alter the binding strategy:
